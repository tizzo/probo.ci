Probo is a continuous integration tool for web development projects. Probo creates test environments for each new feature as your team develops so that everyone (QA or UAT testers, project managers, developers) can see and interact with development changes earlier and more frequently throughout development without waiting for an environment update. Probo is available as an [Open Source](https://github.com/ProboCI/probo) tool, as a Software-as-a-Service application, as well as an on-premise Enterprise solution.
