  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Probo we have a few fundamental principles. Adapted from the <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> Privacy Policy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license.</p>

<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team at info@probo.ci.</p>

<h3 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Like most website operators, Probo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Probo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Probo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Probo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Probo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. Probo only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h3 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Certain visitors to Probo’s websites choose to interact with Probo in ways that require Probo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Probo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>

<h3 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>

<p>Probo may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Probo may monitor the Probo.ci site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Probo may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Probo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Probo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Probo’s behalf or to provide services available at Probo’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Probo’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Probo will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Probo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Probo believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Probo, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Probo website and have supplied your email address, Probo may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Probo and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Probo takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Probo uses cookies to help Probo identify and track visitors, their usage of Probo website, and their website access preferences. Probo visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Probo’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Probo’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>

<p>If Probo, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Probo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Probo may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3 id="ads">Ads</h3>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Probo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Probo may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Probo’s sole discretion. Probo encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
