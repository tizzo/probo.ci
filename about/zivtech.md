  Zivtech, founded in 2008, is a Philadelphia web design and web development shop. We love open source because it helps us do amazing things for our clients and gives them the freedom to innovate and grow. Zivtech works with healthcare, pharmaceuticals, education, publishing, government, startups, and non-profits. Zivtech also partners with other industry leading design and development firms to deliver reliable websites and web applications to [organizations worldwide](https://www.zivtech.com/work). The Hebrew term "ziv" translates to the light that comes from a candle: radiance, beauty, and seeing something new.
