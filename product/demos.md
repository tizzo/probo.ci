Probo.ci can integrate with the git hosting solution your team uses. Here are two useful demos of [Atlassian's Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server) (which was known as Stash until very recently) and [Github](http://github.com/).

If you’re interested in a very simple demonstration of the power of [Probo.ci](http://probo.ci/), please take a look at this demo of integration with [Atlassian’s Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server), or see it on YouTube by going to[zivte.ch/ProboStashDemo](http://zivte.ch/ProboStashDemo).

We also posted a video of Probo.ci working with [Github](http://github.com/), which you can find at[zivte.ch/ProboGithubDemo](http://zivte.ch/ProboGithubDemo). Please note that this video is slightly older than the Bitbucket Server demo, so some of our latest UI improvements won’t be visible.

Shoot us an email at alex@probo.ci if you’d like a demo or to find out how Probo.ci can dramatically improve your Git-based development and approval workflow.
