<h2>Site-seeing made easy</h2>
<p>When you make a new pull request, Probo sets up a copy of your site for you to preview. Probo keeps the environments around as long as you need it, letting your developers, QA testers, project managers, and clients see your work in progress or do final User Acceptance Testing.</p>
