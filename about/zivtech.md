[Zivtech](https://www.zivtech.com/), founded in 2008, is a Philadelphia web design and web development shop specializing in Drupal development, consulting, and training. Drupal is an open source content management system used by many organizations and individuals worldwide. We love open source software because it helps us do amazing things for our clients and gives them the freedom to innovate and grow.

Zivtech works with healthcare, pharmaceuticals, education, publishing, government, startups, and non-profits. We also partners with other industry leading design and development firms to deliver reliable websites and web applications to [organizations worldwide](https://www.zivtech.com/work). The Hebrew term "ziv" translates to the light that comes from a candle: radiance, beauty, and seeing something new. The "tech" is for technology!
