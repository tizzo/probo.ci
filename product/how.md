QA and code review is a critical part of any delivery process. Probo simplifies the workflow and eliminates the need for a senior developer to push and merge changes before testing. Probo creates a real instance of your site where you can preview each change.

1. Developers complete a feature and make a pull request in Github or Stash/Bitbucket.

2. Probo creates a new build.

3. If automated tests pass, itâ€™s ready for review.

4. QA or product owner reviews the new feature in the Probo build.

5. Lead developer reviews code and merges the pull request.
