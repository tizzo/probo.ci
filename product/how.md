Code review is a critical part of any delivery process. Probo simplifies the workflow and eliminates the need for a senior developer to push and merge changes before testing. Probo utilizes real data from your site by spinning up a Docker instance.

1. Complete a feature and submit a pull request.

2. Probo creates a build that can be viewed in GitHub, Stash/Bitbucket.

3. If tests pass, itâ€™s ready for review.

4. Project leads review results and merge changes with a single button.
