### How long does it take for Probo to build a site build?

Once a Pull Request is submitted, Probo starts building a site for each automated test setup. The time it takes to finish building a site depends on the complexity of the database and code. A fresh Drupal site install takes about 1 minute. A medium sized site might take about 10 minutes. A large complex site can take up to 2 hours.

### How much does Probo cost?
It depends. Probo currently has three versions: Open Source Software, Enterprise, and Software-as-a-Service.
